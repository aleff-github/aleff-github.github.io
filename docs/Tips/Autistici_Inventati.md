# Autistici/Inventati

I fully support [Autistici/Inventati](https://www.autistici.org/), a collective dedicated to promoting free and accessible communication on the internet. Their mission to create independent digital spaces where individuals and projects can thrive outside the constraints of commercial and institutional power resonates deeply with me.

## Who They Are

Autistici/Inventati (A/I) is a collective that champions the free, unrestricted sharing of knowledge and resources. They operate an independent server, offering a variety of online services such as web hosting, email, mailing lists, blogs, newsletters, and more. These services are provided free of charge to those who share their vision, rejecting the commercial model of paid services.

## What They Stand For

A/I's philosophy is rooted in these core principles:

- **Privacy**: Ensuring that communication is free from surveillance and control.
- **Freedom**: Providing universal access to digital resources.
- **Non-commercialism**: Offering services without commercial interests.
- **Anti-authoritarianism**: Opposing institutional power structures and promoting self-management.

## Why I Support Them

In a world where digital spaces are increasingly dominated by commercial interests and surveillance, A/I's work is more crucial than ever. They offer a vital refuge for those who resist cultural, media, and global censorship, creating spaces for free expression and creativity.

Their dedication to using and promoting free software and open licenses aligns with my belief in digital freedom and autonomy. By fostering systematic and organized sharing of creative works and documentation, they challenge traditional copyright systems and empower individuals to take control of their digital lives.

## Join the Cause

Supporting A/I is supporting a vision of the internet as it should be: a space for free, open, and uncensored communication. I encourage others to learn more about their work and consider contributing to this essential cause. Together, we can protect and expand the digital commons, ensuring it remains a place where everyone can speak, share, and connect freely.
