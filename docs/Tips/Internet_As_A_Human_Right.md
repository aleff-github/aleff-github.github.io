# Internet Access Should Be a Human Right

Can a child anywhere in the world but without access to the Internet grow up with the same opportunities as another child who has free access to information and services through the Internet? Think about it...

Information has always been somewhat maneuvered by economic policies, and it may even be normal if these media are regarded purely as businesses. Whereas the Internet can provide a space free from these pressures.

## A Response to the New York Times

The recent New York Times article "[Internet Access Is Not a Human Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/opinion/internet-access-is-not-a-human-right.html)" raises some arguments that need much discussion. In this article, I will argue, while I do respect the perspective and view, that the Internet should be seen as an apparent human right. I will present here why the Internet is part of enjoying fundamental human rights and must be recognized as such.

What the New York Times suggests is that technology is no more than a right to practice human rights but not a right by itself. Still, access to the Internet has become a crucial prerequisite for exercising most other fundamental rights in the current era of digitization.

- **Freedom of Expression and Information**: Many citizens cannot freely articulate themselves or access essential information without the Internet. The ability to engage in political, social, and economic dialogue is progressively hinging on Internet connectivity.
- **Education**: A fundamental human right, yet billions of people lack access to online educational resources, courses, and materials. The importance of connectivity for effective remote education has been proven during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Human rights are considered to be universal and inalienable. The idea that some rights are fundamental while others are not might be troublesome. The Internet is so to say into daily life that its absence can effectively serve as a tool to block people's fundamental rights.

- **Civic Participation**: There will be many who are not part of democratic processes, have information from government sources, or are participating in civic movements if they do not access the Internet.
- **Access to Critical Services**: Public services continue to be provided over the web, from health care services to government services. Denial of Internet access amounts to denial of access to these very critical services.

Recognizing the right to Internet access as a human right will mitigate global inequalities. The digital divide between the haves and the have-nots engenders significant differences in opportunities and quality of life. The Internet allows people to get in touch, regardless of their living locations and social status. This is especially crucial for marginalized and isolated communities. Communities that through the Internet have the opportunity to announce themselves to the rest of the world.

One of the arguments opposing Internet access as a fundamental human right is that it has a potentially massive cost in terms of supporting devices and infrastructure. This barrier, too, can be significantly reduced by donating old computers, smartphones, and other such hardware to the less privileged. Many people and organizations upgrade technology very often, leaving numerous functional devices that could be reused. Such items should not be thrown away, instead, donations can be made to those who declare they need these items. Setting up community programs that deal with refurbishment and distribution of old devices has major impacts. The initiatives are not limited to supplying hardware but also contribute to environmental sustainability through reduced electronic waste.

Human rights are not static but evolve with the progress in society. The digital revolution has wholly reformed our way of life and way of doing things. To deny access to the internet as a human right would mean sticking one's head in the sand. Just like human rights that have adjusted to include new concepts related to social and technological changes, it has been essential to consider the importance of the Internet within the current context.

Moreover, comparing a horse that would have allowed one to have a decent life in different times cannot be compared to the internet, which gives people a fair chance to have the right to words globally. I could agree if one proposed the use of Tor as a means to achieve a right, that of privacy, then one would certainly have a better life through its use. But the Internet is badly needed to ensure transparency of news and freedom of speech and communication.

While the New York Times offers a valid view, it is essential to notice that Internet access has become a part and parcel of the fundamental exercise of human rights. It is not a technology or means but a platform on which one would base access to many more rights and opportunities. For these reasons, Internet access must be seen as an unequivocal human right, a prerequisite to achieve equality, participation, and dignity for all people in the modern world. What is more, removing the cost barrier through giving away and recycling old devices actually provides a feasible way to make this right accessible to everyone.
