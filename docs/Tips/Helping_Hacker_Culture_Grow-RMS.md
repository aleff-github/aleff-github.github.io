Stallman urges writers and journalists to accurately differentiate between hackers and crackers. He encourages technical enthusiasts to embrace free Unix operating systems like Linux, FreeBSD, or NetBSD over proprietary software, promoting open-source solutions that foster innovation and community collaboration. Additionally, he calls for support towards organizations like the Free Software Foundation and the League for Programming Freedom, which defend software freedom and oppose restrictive policies that hinder technological advancement.

Furthermore, Stallman highlights the importance of defending internet freedom and combating censorship, pointing to ongoing issues such as restrict encryption. He includes a model letter addressed to editors, urging them to reconsider their pejorative use of "hacker" and adopt a more accurate portrayal that respects the diverse contributions of hackers to technology and society.

Stallman's article is a call to action to protect and nurture hacker culture by advocating for accurate terminology, supporting open-source software development, and defending civil liberties in the digital age.
