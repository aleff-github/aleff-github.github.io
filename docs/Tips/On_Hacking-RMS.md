# On Hacking by Richard Stallman

Richard Stallman's essay "[On Hacking](https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html)" offers an insightful exploration of the original meaning of the term "hacker" and its evolution. Stallman recounts a personal anecdote from 2000 in Korea, where he creatively attempted to use six chopsticks at once during lunch—a playful and challenging endeavor. This act, though not particularly practical, exemplifies hacking as he defines it: the playful exploration of limits with cleverness.

Stallman traces hacking back to its roots at MIT in the 1960s and 1970s, where it encompassed activities ranging from software development to practical jokes and exploration. The essence of hacking, he argues, lies in its spirit of playful cleverness and exploration of what's possible, often disregarding conventional rules. This spirit extends beyond computers to include unconventional acts like John Cage's controversial music piece "4'33"" and historical compositions that embody cleverness and playfulness.

Importantly, Stallman distinguishes hacking from mere wit or art; while these may involve cleverness, hacking involves pushing boundaries and finding unconventional solutions, whether they are practical or not. He laments the media's portrayal of hacking primarily as security breaking, urging a distinction between hacking and cracking. True hackers, in his view, embrace a mindset of curiosity and creativity, challenging norms and finding joy in clever solutions.

Stallman encourages a broader understanding of hacking—one that appreciates its roots in playful exploration and clever problem-solving. His essay serves as a reminder of the diverse and creative spirit that defines hacking beyond its popular, misunderstood portrayal.
