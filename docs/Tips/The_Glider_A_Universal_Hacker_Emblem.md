# The Glider: A Universal Hacker Emblem

"[The Glider: A Universal Hacker Emblem](http://www.catb.org/~esr/hacker-emblem/)" proposes adopting the glider pattern from the Game of Life as a symbolic representation for the hacker community, analogous to other iconic symbols like the Linux penguin or the BSD daemon. This emblem aims to unify various hacker subgroups under a single recognizable symbol.

Initially proposed in October 2003, the glider emblem has gained widespread acceptance among hackers worldwide, although not universally due to some hackers' aversion to formal symbols. Despite this, it has become a successful meme, reflecting solidarity with hacker culture, its values, and its way of life.

By displaying the glider emblem on websites, clothing, or other media, individuals signal their affiliation with hacker ideals and goals, distinct from claiming the title of "hacker" itself, which is typically bestowed by peers (*You can't call yourself a Hacker! Others have to do it*). The emblem is available for non-commercial use, with any proceeds from commercial merchandise typically directed towards organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The article emphasizes that the glider emblem should not be used by individuals associating hacking solely with malicious activities (known as "crackers"). Instead, it is meant for those who appreciate the positive aspects of hacking: creativity, exploration, and technical innovation.

Practically, the emblem is freely available for use, with recommended attribution back to the original proposal or related hacker resources. Various file formats are provided to facilitate its inclusion on different platforms, ensuring accessibility and widespread adoption within the hacker community.

This text advocates for solidarity and recognition within hacker culture through a unifying symbol that celebrates its positive contributions to technology and society.
