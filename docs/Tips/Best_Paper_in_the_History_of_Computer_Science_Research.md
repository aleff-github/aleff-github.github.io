# Best Paper in the History of Computer Science Research

In the annals of academic publishing, few papers have garnered as much attention and amusement as "[Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf)" by David Mazières and Eddie Kohler. Originally penned in 2005, this unique piece of scholarly protest has since become legendary, representing a humorous yet pointed critique of the academic world's dark underbelly: predatory journals and conferences.

## The Origins of a Legend

The story begins with David Mazières and Eddie Kohler, both respected computer scientists. Frustrated by the constant barrage of unsolicited emails from dubious academic conferences and journals, they decided to create a satirical paper. This "paper," if one could call it that, consists solely of the phrase "[Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf)" repeated multiple times. To add a touch of authenticity, the authors included some figures and graphs, all labeled with the same phrase.

## The Prank that Became a Protest

Years after its creation, the paper found new life thanks to Peter Vamplew, an Australian computer scientist equally fed up with predatory practices in academia. In 2014, Vamplew submitted Mazières and Kohler's paper to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology (IJACT), a journal suspected of predatory behavior. To his surprise, the paper was accepted for publication, provided he paid a submission fee.

This acceptance was not just a humorous oversight; it was a glaring indictment of the journal's lack of peer review and quality control. Vamplew's prank highlighted a serious issue in academic publishing, exposing how some journals prioritize profit over academic integrity.

## Why It Matters

The acceptance of "[Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf)" by a predatory journal underscores a critical problem in the academic world. Predatory journals exploit researchers by promising rapid publication without rigorous peer review, often at high costs. This undermines the credibility of scientific research and exploits academics, particularly those under pressure to publish.

The paper's widespread recognition and the story behind it serve as a cautionary tale. It reminds researchers to be vigilant about where they submit their work and encourages institutions to foster environments where quality and integrity are paramount.

## A Symbol of Resistance

"[Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf)" has transcended its initial purpose as a humorous protest. It has become a symbol of resistance against the exploitative practices of predatory journals and conferences. Its story is shared among academics as both a warning and a source of amusement, a rare blend of humor and serious critique.

In the history of computer science research, few papers have achieved the legendary status of "[Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf)." What started as a satirical response to spam emails evolved into a powerful critique of academic publishing practices. It stands as a reminder that even in the serious world of scientific research, there is room for humor and that sometimes, the best way to make a point is to break all the rules.

This paper's journey from inbox annoyance to academic legend is a testament to the power of creativity and the importance of maintaining integrity in research. It is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable papers in the history of computer science research.
