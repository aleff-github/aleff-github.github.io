# Supporting Important Projects

I am passionate about supporting projects that make a significant impact on the digital world, particularly those that promote freedom, privacy, and security. I provide financial support, and whenever possible, technical assistance to the following projects:

## Free Software Foundation (FSF)

## Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is dedicated to defending civil liberties in the digital world. They work on a wide range of issues including privacy, free expression, and innovation. Through legal action, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development, the EFF aims to ensure that technology supports freedom and justice.

The Tor Project develops and maintains the Tor software, which enables anonymous communication on the internet. By routing traffic through a worldwide volunteer network, Tor helps protect users' privacy and freedom to communicate without being tracked or monitored.

## Signal

Signal is an open-source messaging app that focuses on privacy and security. It uses advanced end-to-end encryption to ensure that all communication through the app is secure and cannot be intercepted. Signal's commitment to privacy and user security makes it a vital tool in the digital age.

## Autistici/Inventati (A/I)

Autistici/Inventati is a collective that creates free online spaces for open communication and social projects. They offer services like web hosting, email, mailing lists, blogs, and newsletters to those aligned with their mission of free and accessible communication, outside commercial interests. They reject commercial activities, clergy, institutional political parties, and any entity with other means to share their content.

They promote the free sharing of knowledge and resources, supporting the fight against traditional copyright and advocating for free software and open licenses.

Supporting these projects is a way for me to contribute to a more open, secure, and just digital world. If you share my values, I encourage you to support these organizations as well.
